# Deco Scope

A helper webapp for deco sniping in Monster Hunter: World.

Live [here].

## Deco-Sniping

An [in-depth explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/7zqifh/melder_decoration_sniping_and_you_a_guide_to/) can be found elsewhere, but the basics are:

1. Save, and back it up (for PC users, this [script](https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/973xjq/i_wrote_a_script_to_automatically_backup_monster/) makes it easier).
2. Meld as much as you can/want. Record the results with the app's Record Mode.
3. Restore your backed-up save. Use Snipe Mode to keep track of meld results.

Reminder: when you first start sniping, you will need to backup and meld after each hunt to determine where you are in the 1-1-2 quest advance pattern. You can set this in Record Mode.

## Limitations

The app persists your data using your browser's `localStorage`, so if you wish to change devices, you will need to re-enter your results manually.
